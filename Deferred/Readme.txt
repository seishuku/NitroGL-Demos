Deferred Rendering/Shading

Most of the point of this demo is actually in the source code,
visually it doesn't look much different than some of my other demos.
So if you know some OpenGL, some C/C++, and are interested in
deferred rendering/shading, take a looks at the source code.

Yes, I know that this demo runs kind of slow, but that's because
there are 3, 128bit floating point buffers being rendered to...

Requirements:
Radeon 9500+, with at least Cat3.8 drivers (only tested with Cat3.9).

Controls:
Left mouse button = Rotate
Middle mouse button = Pan
Right mouse button = Zoom
