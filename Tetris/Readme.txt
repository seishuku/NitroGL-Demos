*** NOTE ON MUSIC ***
Since most music is copyrighted, I'm not going to include any in this demo,
however, you can encode your own OGG Vorbis music and place it in the game's
directory and it will play the songs at random (it scans the directory on start).

It won't scan sub-directories, so make sure the music in the directory where you
installed the game.

You can get encoder and tools here:

Copyright notice:
The audio (SFX) was recorded from "Tetris" on the NES, so it's probably copyright Nintendo,
but it's just simple digitized audio and such an old game, so I doubt they will care.

In the case that they do and actually contact me, I am willing to change the audio.

Linux note:
While there is GLX and linux support code, it doesn't compile as far as I know.
