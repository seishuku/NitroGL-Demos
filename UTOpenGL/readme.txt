UT TruForm OpenGL Renderer

Based on the 4.36 Patch OpenGL Renderer.

ONLY WORKS ON THE RADEON (and RV200/R200)!

Install:
Unzip the OpenGLDrv.dll file to your UT/system directory, and select OpenGL as your Renderer (if it isn't already).

Things I need to do still:
Add adjustable TruForm Tesselation, will fix in the next release.

Enjoy!

(Note, this only took 20 minutes to mod the renderer to use TruForm)
