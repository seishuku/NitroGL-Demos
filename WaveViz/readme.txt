Wave Viz - an Application independent waveform visualizer

To use:
In the windows mixer, select the Options menu, Properties, then select the Recording radio button, and click ok.
From there, select an input source and close the mixer.  Now, run Wave Viz and play an MP3 or whatever
(depending on what input source you selected from the mixer).

Note:
This Application uses ATI's Fragment shader OpenGL extension, but does not require it (looks better with it though).
